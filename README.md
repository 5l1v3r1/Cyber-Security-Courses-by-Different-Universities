# MOOCS

Lets first take a look at a few MOOCs that are being offered by universities.

* [Cyber security by futurelearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/degrees/deakin-university/cyber-security) is a great mooc which is offered by Deakin University.
* [Cybersecurity micro masters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ritx-cybersecurity) degree via RIT on Edx is a great way to learn about cyber security. It consists of several courses and you can audit all of them for free.
* [Cyber security specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cyber-security) by University of Maryland is also a great specialization to do. One can audit the courses for free.
* [Computer Systems Security](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/video-lectures/) is a class by MIT which is a bit advanced. But the videos are great and the instructors are top notch.

# University Courses

Lets take a look at some courses taught at universities to their students. Most of these courses have their slides available as well as the projects and homeworks. Reading the slides and getting your hands dirty on a project/lab can be a great way to get into cyber security.


* [Introduction to Computer Security](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs388/) by University of Michigan. I love this course. Period. This course takes you from a beginner level to an intermediate level and is very well structured. There are a lot of homeworks and projects and you really learn a lot.
* [Computer Systems Security](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs166/lectures/) by Brown University is another great course although a bit advanced.
* [Internet Security](http://www.icir.org/vern/cs261n/) by Berkeley is another great course but it is bit advanced.
* [Introduction to Computer Security](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~dbrumley/courses/18487-f13/) by CMU is another good course for beginners.
* [Computer and Network Security](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/) by Stanford is a great course. This is a well structured course and is offered every year at stanford. The projects and homeworks are very good.
* [Introduction to Computer Security](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~byoung/cs361/syllabus361.html) by University of Texas is another comprehensive and intro level course.
